# vhdl
Iin this journey, I am teaching myself VHDL, to diversify my skills as a potential RTL engineer. 

During my free time when I am not doing assignments for my courses, I am learning this language. 

I aim to develop readable, modular HDL. And I aim for my circuits to be reusable such that I can instantiate them and re-use my generic code rather than hard-coding.

Books that I have purchased that are being used to teach myself VHDL that may be of use to you:

The Designer's Guide to VHDL
Fundamentals of Digital Logic with VHDL Design.


I am also re-using contents from my Verilog and system Verilog courses and attempting to translate them to VHDL. Sadly, those contents are not available to the public.
