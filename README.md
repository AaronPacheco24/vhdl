# Learning VHDL for RTL Engineering

Welcome to my journey of self-learning VHDL! My goal is to diversify my skills as a potential RTL (Register Transfer Level) engineer. In my free time, alongside my regular coursework, I'm dedicated to mastering this hardware description language.

## Objectives

- Develop readable and modular HDL (Hardware Description Language) code.
- Create circuits that are reusable, allowing me to instantiate and repurpose my generic code rather than hard-coding.

## Learning Resources

Here are some valuable resources I've been using on my journey:

1. **The Designer's Guide to VHDL**: This book provides fundamental insights into VHDL and is a cornerstone of my learning process.

2. **Fundamentals of Digital Logic with VHDL Design**: Another great resource that helps bridge the gap between digital logic and VHDL design.

## Reusing Previous Knowledge

I'm also leveraging my experience with Verilog and SystemVerilog by translating concepts and code to VHDL. Unfortunately, the contents from those courses are not publicly available, but I'll do my best to share my insights and learnings on this platform.

Feel free to join me on this journey of VHDL exploration, and together, we can dive into the world of digital design and RTL engineering!

Happy coding!
